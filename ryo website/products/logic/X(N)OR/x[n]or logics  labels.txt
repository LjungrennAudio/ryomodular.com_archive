Boolean Logic

Discrete Resistor-Transistor-Logic
 
RTL circuit design gives interesting quirks at Dif input amplitudes, waveforms and frequency ratescincluding audit use as an audio waveshaper/distortion.
 
NOR/OR

The NOR/OR module can be patched as two NOT gates,
one NOT gate and one 2- or 3-input NOR/OR gate,
one 2-input NOR/OR gate and one 2- or 3-input NOR/OR gate
or one 4-input NOR/OR gate.
 
Gate one has three inputs
Gate two has two
The OR out from gate one is normalled to input 1 on gate two.
