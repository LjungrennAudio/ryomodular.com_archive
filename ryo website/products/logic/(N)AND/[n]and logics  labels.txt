Boolean Logic

Discrete Resistor-Transistor-Logic
 
RTL circuit design gives interesting quirks at Dif input amplitudes, waveforms and frequency rates including audit use as an audio waveshaper/distortion.
 
 
NAND/AND

The NAND/AND module can be patched as two NOT gates,
one NOT gate and one 2- or 3-input NAND/AND gate,
one 2-input NAND/AND gate and one 2- or 3-input NAND/AND gate
or one 4-input NAND/AND gate.
 
Gate one has three inputs, the inputs on gate one are normalled 1>2>3

Gate two has two, the inputs on gate two are normalled 1>2

the AND out from gate one in turn being normalled to input 1 on gate two.
