Ampmix
 
CV and audio mixer/processor
precision
high impedance input
buffered output
 
It works as a 4 channel mixer,
1 attenuator + 3 channel mixer,
2 attenuators + 2 channel mixer
or 4 attenuators.
With up to 2.0x gain (6dB) on each channel.
 
An offset voltage is generated then normaled to the inputs of the 4 channels, giving them a maximum of 5V out each with knobs turned full clockwise (2.0x gain).
