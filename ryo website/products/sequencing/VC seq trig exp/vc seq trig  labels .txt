Trig Xpander (for VC Sequencer)
 
This will give your VC Sequencer 8 individual outputs for each step 

outputting either a trigger or a gate, selectable with a jumper on the pcb, 

9th output that gives you a trigger for each step progression.
 
(trimmer sets the trigger length to between approx 1-20 ms.)
The gates are high for the full duration of each step.
 
The outputs are diode isolated for passive mixing using passive multiples, stackcables, switched multiples and OR combiners such as the Doepfer A-182 or Low-Gain Short Bus.
