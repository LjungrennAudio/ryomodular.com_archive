3xVCA Features:

( mod to normal the VCAs in a cascading fashion allows both linear and exponential responses.)

1.
Control voltage input. Can be calibrated for either 5V or 8V CV.

2.
DC coupled signal input, linear response.

3.
Signal output. If modded then will be normalled to vca below.

4.
Control voltage input. Can be calibrated for either 5V or 8V CV.

5.
DC coupled signal input, linear response. 

6.
Signal output. If modded then normalled to vca below.

7.
Control voltage input. Can be calibrated for either 5V or 8V CV.

8.
DC coupled signal input, linear response. If modded then will be expo response when nothing is connected to above output.

9.
Signal output.
