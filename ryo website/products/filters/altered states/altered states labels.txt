Altered States

12db/oct

Controls:
 
2, 4. Frequency cutoff control knob
6, 9. Resonance amount control knob
7, 8. Frequency cutoff CV attenuverter knob
11, 12. Input level attenuator with overdrive knob
10, 13.Variable state control minishaft type
15, 17. Resonance amount CV attenuverter minishaft type
 
Inputs/Outputs:
 
22, 23. Filter audio input
19, 26. Frequency cutoff CV input
20, 25. Frequency cutoff 1V/O scaled input - around 5 octaves of 1V/O tracking sine wave @self-oscillation. the LP, BP and HP outputs each have a different phased sine.
21, 24. Resonance amount CV input
14, 18. Variable state CV input
30, 31. Variable state output (LP-Notch-HP) The state outputs offer seamless fading between lowpass and highpass filter response, with an all-pass/notch response around 50% of the knob setting
29, 32. Lowpass output
B2, 33. 8andpass output
27, 34. Highpass output
 
3. toggle switches for Combine (links the filter B frequency cutoff controls to filter A), and
16. serial or parallel input routing.
