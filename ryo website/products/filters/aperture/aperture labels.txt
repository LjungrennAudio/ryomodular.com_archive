Aperture

Switching:

* Non resonant lowpass filter
* Resonant lowpass filter
* Both: Non resonant lowpass gate
* Both: Resonant lowpass gate
* VCA
* 6dB variety of resonant lowpass gate in the VCA mode with resonance on.
 
The resonance to wild and untamed howling towards the end of the pots range. 

The self-oscillation also lends itself well to creating kickdrums, toms and other percussive sounds. 
 
The Klang input generates a decay slope from a trigger, the shape is very steep in the beginning and quickly smooths out to a nice prolonged ring -  accepts variety of trigger voltages and lengths and other control voltages

CV input will also accept triggers

the input is AC coupled 

a dedicated attenuator with clipping overdrive towards the end of the pot range

The signal input is scaled for 10Vpp audio signals. [The AC coupling comes after the overdrive circuit so you can add offsets to your audioto get an asymmetric clipping].
