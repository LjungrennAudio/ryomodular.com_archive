FOR POWER


You'll with need a lab/bench-top type psi, or alternatively, you can get a smog eurorack psi like the tiptop happy ending kit [hek].

- The lab psi's have pro's: stable, accurate power to be dialled in at whatver voltage and amperage you choose

- The hek has the pro's: provides actual real life eurorack module power to see the effects of actual setups effects. 
- Bonus pro's: holds maybe 7-10 eurorack modules in a little desktop skeleton rack, allowing a set of vco/vca/eg/lfo/filter/etc as test modules! 
- (See how your breadboard circuits behave with and respond to real life eurorack modules!)



FOR RYO PROTECTED BREADBOARD POWER [optional:]

Solderless Prototyping Breadboard 80mm x 60mm, 390 tie points: 29 columns in 2 banks of 5 plus 4 rows of 25


- [if using an hek or similar to power the breadboard:
8-Way single red-stripe ribbon cable approx 30cm length,
female 16-pin IDC connector,
(optional, and highly convenient: idc crimping tool).]

- [if using a bench-top/lab psu to power the breadboard:
lab/bench-top PSU, 
Approx 30cm of 4 x Dif colour solid core wire to connect psi to the breadboard.]
