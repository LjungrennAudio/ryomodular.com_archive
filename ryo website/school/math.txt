XOR using 4 NAND gates, inputs are 0 or 1.

XOR(a, b) = NAND(d, e), where c = NAND(a, b), d = NAND(a, c), and e = NAND(b, c).


At least k. A n-way majority circuit takes n inputs and returns 1 if and only if at least strictly more of its inputs are 1 than 0. Given an n-way majority circuit, describe how to build an At-Least-k circuit that returns 1 if and only if at least k of its inputs are 1. Answer: consider a 2n-way majority circuit. Make n-k+1 of the inputs 1, k-1 of the inputs 0, and the original n inputs.

Exactly k circuit. Describe how to build a circuit that outputs 1 if and only if exactly k of its inputs are 1. Answer: If k = n, use an n-way and gate. Otherwise build up an At-least-k circuit and an At-least-k+1 circuit as in the previous exercise. It has exactly k inputs that are 1 if the first circuit outputs 1, but the second one outputs 0.

The voltage output for the operational amplifier differentiator can be determined from the relationship below:

Vout =−R C dVin/dt
Where:
    Vout = output voltage from op amp differentiator
    Vin = input voltage
    t = time in seconds
    R = resistor value in the differentiator in Ω
    C = capacitance of differentiator capacitor in Farads
    dVin/dt = rate of change of voltage with time.
